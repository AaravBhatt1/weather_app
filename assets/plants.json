The fruits are slightly astringent, with smooth, yellow-green flesh, and have a rich flavour ideal for many culinary uses, but particularly for jams and preserves.Damsons are smaller and less sweet than plums, but ideal for making into deliciously rich jams and dessertsDamsons (Prunusinsititia) are closely related toplums(Prunusdomestica) and\u00a0have been grown in Britain since at least Roman times. Traditional damson-growing regions include Shropshire, Kent, Worcestershire, Westmorland (Cumbria) and Cheshire, where they were once grown in vast orchards. Some of the old regional varieties are still available, as well as several more recently bred options.The trees are simple to plant and like a warm, sunny spot with fertile soil that doesn\u2019t get waterlogged. If you don\u2019t have space for a free-standing tree, you can grow a fan-trained tree flat against a wall or fence, or a tree grafted on a dwarfing rootstock in a large container. In larger gardens, they make a great addition to a wildlife-friendlyhedgerowand are tough enough to act as awindbreak.

You may be lucky enough to have a tree in your garden already, but if not, they\u2019re easy to plant and you can even grow compact trees\u00a0in containers.Pears are ready to harvest in late summer and autumn, depending on the varietyPear trees announce the arrival of spring with a froth of joyful blossom, then\u00a0the young fruits swell as the weather warms, to provide a plentiful harvest of sweet succulent pears from late summer into autumn. Suitable for every size of garden, large or small, pears can be grown either as free-standing trees or trained against a wall\u00a0to take up barely any ground space. Compact varieties and trees grafted on a dwarfing rootstock can be grown in a large container.Young pear trees are very easy to plant and like a warm, sunny, sheltered spot in fertile soil that drains freely. There are many varieties to choose from, producing fruit of different shapes, colours, flavours and textures. Pear trees need little maintenance once established, although it\u2019s beneficial to prune them annually to keep them in good shape and fruiting well. The fruit should be harvested just before it\u2019s ripe and brought indoors to complete the ripening process, which can take a month or more depending on the variety. This means you can enjoy your harvest gradually, savouring each sweet juicy fruit as it reaches perfection.",

        "description": "Grapes are becoming much more widely grown in the UK, with vineyards appearing on sunny hillsides in warmer regions, producing many award-winning wines. Grapevines(Vitis\u00a0vinifera) also make an attractive feature in gardens, but for a successful crop of ripe grapes, they need a particularly warm, sheltered, sunny location or the protection of a greenhouse. Still, with our warming climate, the range of growing sites is ever expanding.Planted in a warm, sunny location and pruned regularly, grapevines can produce a large cropGrape varieties are classified as either wine or dessert grapes, although there is some overlap. Wine varieties tend to ripen more reliably than dessert types in the UK, but are not usually too good for eating. There are also a few dessert varieties that will crop outdoors in very warm, sunny spots, usually in southern England. Both types can also be grown in a greenhouse, where their grapes will ripen much more reliably.Grapevines are fast-growing climbing plants that need plenty of space. They will happily scramble overpergolasand arches, or can be trained along horizontal wires attached to sunny walls, fences, sturdy posts or the internal framework of a greenhouse. To get the best crop, vines need regular attention throughout the growing season, including careful pruning, training and fruit thinning.Related RHS GuidesFascinating facts about grapes",

They produce large white flowers in late spring, followed by small rounded fruits (about 5cm/2in across) for picking in autumn, and fiery-tinted autumn foliage.Medlar fruits are a curious delicacy, popular in medieval times but now not widely grown. Harvested in autumn when usually still hard, bitter and unripe, the small golden-brown fruits need to be stored for several weeks to ripen (or blet) until they are dark brown, soft, sweet and aromatic. They can then either be eaten (traditionally with cheese and port) or, more popularly, used to make afragrant amber jellyto accompany rich meats. They can also be used in sweet desserts.\u00a0Medlar fruits are very rarely available to buy, although you may sometimes find medlar jelly, so the best way to enjoy these unusual fruits is to grow your own.Related RHS GuidesFascinating facts about medlars",

Examples include daffodils, tulips, hyacinths, lilies, onions and garlic. The term is often used to cover other underground storage organs, including corms, tubers and rhizomes.bulbsare fairly expensive to buy, it\u2019s a prized crop to grow. However, it can be tricky, easilybolting(flowering), which means the bulb either doesn\u2019t form or turns woody and inedible. It fares best in warm, damp summers and is well worth the effort if you can give it the right conditions. It may be less successful in colder regions and heavy clay soil.The key to success is to provide regular water, never letting the soil dry out, so plants keep growing strongly. Early to mid-summer is the best time to sow, once temperatures have warmed up. The bulbs take three or four months to mature, but you can harvest at any size \u2013baby bulbscan be enjoyed after only about six weeks. Fennel bulbs can be eaten raw, sliced or grated into salads, or cooked in all kinds of dishes. The young feathery leaves can also be used as a flavouring.Florence fennel is a handsome, upright plant that takes up little ground space, so is ideal for small gardens and containers, as well as open ground. With its green feathery foliage, it\u2019s ornamental as well as edible, making an attractive feature in any garden.\nThese are fleshy, rounded, underground storage organs, usually sold and planted while dormant.

With modern varieties offering much improved flavour, this versatile veg has seen a revival in popularity and is now used in a wide range of dishes, not just the traditional festive feast.Brussels sprouts will provide you with fresh, tasty harvests for Christmas and beyondSlow but relatively easy to grow, Brussels sprouts provide valuable harvests through the leaner winter months. A member of the brassica (cabbage) family, they are very hardy and crop well through even the coldest winters. In fact, sprouts have the sweetest flavour when harvested after being frosted.Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea(Gemmifera Group)) form large, quirky-looking plants\u00a0about 90cm\u00a0(3ft) tall, with a leafy top and sturdy stem covered in small rounded sprouts. This crop is slow to mature \u2013 sown from early spring onwards, it\u2019s\u00a0ready to harvest from autumn to late winter, depending on the variety and sowing time. While plants do take up quite a lot of space for a large part of the year, you don\u2019t need many, as they should crop well, providing valuable fresh harvests across the winter months.So why not try growing your own sprouts for a Christmas Day treat? Modern varieties have a mild, nutty, sweet flavour \u2013 far better than you may remember from childhood. Freshly picked sprouts are also full of health-boosting nutrients.

Best sown indoors or bought\u00a0as young plants, sweetcorn needs in a warm, sunny site to ensure the cobs ripen over the summer. You can also grow baby corn and popcorn in a similar way, for added variety.Long, hot summers are ideal for sweetcorn, allowing the cobs to develop well and ripen fullySweetcorn (Zea mays) is best eaten as soon as possible after picking, as its sweetness declines, especially with older varieties. So growing your own, and harvesting just before you\u2019re ready to cook it, gives a huge advantage in terms of flavour, which is far superior to shop-bought cobs. Sweetcorn is most successful in long, hot summers, although many modern varieties are better suited to our cooler climate. Sweetcorn plants are tender, so are best sown indoors, then planted out after the last frost. They grow rapidly in warm conditions to form tall plants, each usually bearing two cobs that ripen from mid-summer onwards. Expect to harvest six to nine cobs from one square metre/yard of ground.Sweetcorn is not suited to growing in containers, as it\u2019s so tall.

The nectar-rich flowers\u00a0attract butterflies, bees and other pollinators. Dill is pretty enough to\u00a0grace flower borders as well as herb beds and veg plots. It also does well in containers, especially the more compact varieties.Dill is a short-lived plant, producing leafy harvests for several weeks until, sooner or later, it starts to flower. Sow it outdoors from mid-spring in a sunny spot, and you can start harvesting leaves in as little as eight weeks. If you sow several small batches from spring to mid-summer, you\u2019ll have fresh dill leaves to enjoy through into autumn. And if you let dill flower and set seed, you\u2019ll also get self-sown plants to harvest too.Dill leaves are traditionally used to flavour chicken, fish and egg dishes, and of course dill pickles, and can be chopped into soups and salads.

Several species ofoxalisare also commonly known as sorrel, but these are ornamental plants, wildflowers or weeds.The three edible species of sorrel form low leafy plants, which are best harvested regularly to encourage a steady supply of fresh young leaves. Older leaves can become tough and bitter. They will send up tall flower spikes in summer, which should be removed if you want to keep picking the leaves. If the leaves get too large, simply cut them back to encourage fresh young growth.Sorrel is easy to grow from seed or can be bought as young plants, and is happy in sun or light shade, in most types of soil. Plants live for several years, dying back over winter then re-sprouting from the ground in spring \u2013 although young plants may be more productive, so you may prefer to sow them fresh each year.",

        "description": "Grown for its spicy, pungent leaves, oregano is a sun-loving Mediterranean herb. Easy to grow, compact and drought tolerant, it thrives in pots or in the ground. It\u2019s widely used in Italian and Greek cuisine, especially when dried.Oregano forms a low clump of small aromatic leaves and sends up attractive pink or white flowerheads in summer, about 30cm (1ft) tall. It\u2019s a perennial, living for many years, and is usually hardy enough to survive the British winter if grown in a warm sunny spot, in a container or in free-draining soil.You can harvest the leaves regularly through spring and summer to enjoy in a wide range of dishes, infusing them with rich Mediterranean flavour. Oregano leaves are usually used dried, but can also be added fresh at the end of cooking. Dried oregano is a key ingredient in many pizza and pasta sauces, as it goes particularly well with tomato.Oregano looks great planted in a herb bed or herb container with other aromatic sun-lovers, such as marjoram, sage and thyme. It also works well in gravel gardens, dry gardens, Mediterranean-style plantings and pollinator-friendly borders, as the flowers are a magnet for butterflies and bees.Oregano and its close relative marjoram are often confused \u2013 they look very similar, like the same growing conditions and both are types of Origanum. There is a lot of overlap between them, but as a general distinction, oregano leaves tend to be spicier, more pungent and more often used dried, while marjoram leaves have milder, sweeter flavour and are usually used fresh.",

It is highly prized in French cuisine and goes well with fish, eggs and chicken. It is also used to flavour vinegar, mustard, salad dressing, butter and sauces, and can be finely chopped in salads or omelettes.There are two types of tarragon:\nFrench tarragon(Artemisia dracunculusFrench) \u2013 more highly regarded, the leaves have a strong, sweet, peppery flavour with hints of aniseed. It is needs protection from frost and doesn\u2019t produce viable seeds\nRussian tarragon(Artemisia dracunculusRussian) \u2013 easier to grow, more vigorous and fully hardy, the leaves have a mild, slightly bitter flavour without the aniseed tones. The small yellow-green flowers in mid- to late summer attract pollinating insects\nBoth like a warm sheltered location in full sun, in well-drained soil or a large container.",
